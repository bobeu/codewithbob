## Welcome to #Codewithbob

First coding session on 17th Octobre 2022.
### This session introduces you to the following: 
- Setting up a project:
  - Create a repository, I recommend that you just clone this repository to follow along. Simple: 
    - Open a new window of Visual Studio Code, at the top, look out for `Terminal`, click on it, then from the dropdown, launch a new terminal.
    - In the terminal, you should be in home directory. run the following code:
    ```mkdir codewithbob```
    ```cd codewithbob```
    ```git clone https://github.com/bobeu/codewithbob.git```
    ```cd codewithbob```

    If you're running the commands from other terminals, the run: ```code .```

## What this session is all about
We are simply setting up a solidity/hardhat project, understanding solidity file structure, and introduction to solidity data types.

# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
